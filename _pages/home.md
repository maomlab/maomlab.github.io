# Maom Lab @ UMich

We a computational pharmacology group in the [Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/computational-medicine-bioinformatics) at the [Univerersity of Michigan](https://umich.edu/) in Ann Arbor, Michigan. We use computational and statistical modeling to develop chemical probes.

In science models are used to simulate the behavior of intractable systems that we want to understand. For example, cell-culture may be use to model an organisms response to drugs.

In our group, we do two types of modeling. First we use <u>molecular simulations</u> and <u>deep neural networks</u> to represent how molecules and chemicals interact. While computational models are can be quite realistic, often they are intractable and difficult to compare with biochemical and phenotypic measurements. So, second we use <u>statistical models</u> to facilitate summarizing experimental data and making inferences.

We are fortunate to collaborate with a range of exciting experimental labs, where we work closely with them to analyze the data and plan new experiments.
