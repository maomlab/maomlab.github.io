# Molecular ML Reading Group
The Molecular ML Reading Group aims to explore foundational and recent applications of machine learning models to modeling molecular system.
The reading group is hosted by Rosetta Commons (https://www.rosettacommons.org/) and organized by Nick Randolph a PhD candidate in the
Kuhlman Lab at UNC Chapel Hill (nzrandol@unc.edu) and Matthew O'Meara an Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan (maom@umich.edu).

### Introduction to Diffusion Models (9/13)
Diffusion models is a Deep Learning architecture that has lead to breakthroughs in generating realistic structured data from images, text, and sound.
Diffusion models have also been used to generate proteins and other biomolecular systems. In this first meeting, Nick gives an overview of the basics
of the diffusion model architecture including how to efficiently add noisy data and efficiently train the models by predicting the noise, and generate
samples by iteratively removing the predicted noise. We cover ideas developed in the following works
