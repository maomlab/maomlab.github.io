### Umol (11/22/2023)
This week [Patrick Bryant](https://www.scilifelab.se/researchers/patrick-bryant/) from Frank Noé's lab at FU Berlin and starting his own group soon at Stockholm University/Science for Life Laboratory joined us to discuss [Umol](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.03.565471v1), a deep learning based ligand docking method. He gives some interesting details about trying to train a variant of AlphaFold2 that considers small molecule atoms and balancing the more abundant constraints from the mulitple sequence alignment with the less abundant constraints for the ligand geometry.

### FlowFold (11/08/2023)
This week Joey Bose, Tara Akhound-Sadegh, and colleagues join us to present FoldFlow (Bose et al., 2023), a conditional flow matching model for protein backbone generation. Using insights from differential geometry they improve the training of flows on the Riemannian manifold over a collection of protein backbone frames. They achieve SOTA performance on non-pretrained de novo backbone generation for a number of metrics.

### RoseTTAFold All-Atom (10/25/2023)
This week we Rohith Krishna, a graduate student in the Baker Lab at UW, joins us to present RoseTTAFold All-Atom (Krishna, et al., 2023).
This work generalizes the RoseTTA Fold "three-track architecture" to handle non-protein molecules. They then use this
for a range of different applications including re-training RFDiffusion to enable predicting ligand and cofactor binding.

### FrameDiff (9/27/2023)
This week we dug into (Yim, et al., 2023) introducing FrameDiff, a new Diffusion model for protein backbone generation. In this work they
develop the theory of diffusion/denoising machine learning over Remannian manifolds. As a key application they consider each backbone residue as
a rigid frame similar to AlphaFold2. Since each frame has rotational and translational symmetry in 3D, the diffusion should be SE(3) equivariant.
In contrast with RFDiffusion which directly predicts coordinates, in this work they use the stochastic differential equation / score matching
version of diffusion/denoising developed in (Song, et al., 2021). In particular they work out the math for Brownian diffusion on this manifold.
To test their model they train their model directly on a curated subset of the protein databank (unlike RFDiffusion which uses a pre-trained
structure prediction module), and measure the designability, diversity, and novelty of FrameDiff generated backbones. While it was difficult for them
to direclty compare with RFDiffusion because at the time RFDiffusion code was not yet released, it appears to be not quite as performant, but
significantly faster and the model is only 1/4 the size.

### Introduction to Diffusion Models (9/13/2023)
Diffusion models is a Deep Learning architecture that has lead to breakthroughs in generating realistic structured data from images, text, and sound.
Diffusion models have also been used to generate proteins and other biomolecular systems. In this first meeting, Nick gives an overview of the basics
of the diffusion model architecture including how to efficiently add noisy data and efficiently train the models by predicting the noise, and generate
samples by iteratively removing the predicted noise. We cover ideas developed in the following works

* Sohl-Dickstein et al. (2015) (https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03585)
* Yang & Ermon (2019) (https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05600)
* Ho et al. (2020) (https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239)
